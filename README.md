# dos-backupper or CMD-BACK-UP.bat - A script to backup settings on windows machines. 2023

As someone who often helps others with fixing computers I thought it would be neat to have a dos cmd script to 
backup various parts of a windows machine. The use of such a script is questionable. But having started this project
it is gathering momentum, as I can see it being of some use.

CMD-BACK-UP.bat

A dos script that will back up registry, drivers ,firewall settings and other settings as well as running various
other useful tasks.

Soon I will upload what I have ! Cheers
